# Design Details:

__Push Registration:__ To use Notification message in your game you have to register your game for PushNotification 
by calling this method in your main cs file.

```
       public void RegisterForPush(){
		 object[] args1 = new object[]{constants.projectNo};
		 object[] args0 = new object[]{constants.apiKey,constants.secretKey};
		 object[] args2= new object[]{constants.userId};
         	 object[] args3 = new object[]{constants.callBackMethod,constants.gameObjectName};
         	 using (AndroidJavaClass cls_obj= new AndroidJavaClass("com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer")) {
        	 using (AndroidJavaObject act_Obj = cls_obj.GetStatic<AndroidJavaObject>("currentActivity")) {
				act_Obj.Call("intialize",args0);
				act_Obj.Call("setProjectNo",args1);
				act_Obj.Call("setCurrentUser",args2);
                act_Obj.Call("registerForNotification",args3);
         		 }
